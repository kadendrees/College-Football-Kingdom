                  <h1 class="section-heading">The History of College Football</h1>
                  <p>College football has long been a centerpiece of American sports culture. Its origins trace back to the mid-19th century, with the first intercollegiate game played on November 6, 1869, between Rutgers and Princeton. That historic match resembled more of a soccer game than what we know today as football.</p>
                  <p>In the decades that followed, college football evolved quickly. Rules changed, equipment improved, and rivalries began to shape fan loyalty. By the early 1900s, powerhouse programs like Yale, Harvard, and Army were dominating the sport and setting the tone for the fierce competition we see today.</p>
                  <p>One of the pivotal moments in college football history came in 1905, when rising injuries and even fatalities sparked national concern. This led to the formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States, which later became the NCAA — a governing body that would regulate the sport's rules and safety protocols.</p>
          
                  <h2 class="section-heading">Legendary Programs and Iconic Rivalries</h2>
                  <p>Throughout the 20th century, legendary programs such as Alabama, Notre Dame, Michigan, USC, and Ohio State emerged as dominant forces. Iconic rivalries — like the Iron Bowl (Alabama vs. Auburn), The Game (Ohio State vs. Michigan), and the Red River Rivalry (Texas vs. Oklahoma) — became national spectacles with millions of fans tuning in each year.</p>
                  <blockquote class="blockquote">
                    “College football is not just a game; it’s a tradition, a passion, and a way of life for generations of fans.”
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>The introduction of televised games in the 1950s brought college football into homes across America. This exposure helped grow the sport’s popularity and brought national attention to players and coaches alike.</p>
          
                  <h2 class="section-heading">Modern Era and the College Football Playoff</h2>
                  <p>In recent years, college football has seen even greater change. The Bowl Championship Series (BCS) gave way to the College Football Playoff (CFP) system in 2014, allowing the top four teams to compete for a true national title. This brought both excitement and controversy, as fans debated rankings and playoff selections.</p>
                  <p>Now, with NIL (Name, Image, Likeness) rules allowing athletes to profit from endorsements and a looming CFP expansion, college football stands at a crossroads — balancing tradition with innovation.</p>

                  <p>From leather helmets to high-tech uniforms, and from dusty local fields to billion-dollar stadiums, college football has become more than just a sport. It's a cultural phenomenon that unites students, alumni, and fans across the country every fall Saturday.</p>
